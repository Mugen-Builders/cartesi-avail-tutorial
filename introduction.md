# Introduction

This guide will walk you through setting up a Cartesi dApp using Avail on your local machine. You will learn how to send transactions either directly (through Cartesi Rollups Smart Contracts deployed on an L1) or through Avail DA using EIP-712 signed messages. Also how to inspect the dApp state and outputs through the APIs provided by the Cartesi Rollups Framework.
